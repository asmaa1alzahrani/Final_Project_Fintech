### Project:
Predicting Loan Defaults using ML model.

### What is your project?
The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict and comprehend the previous customers' profiles in order to mitigate future loan default risk. We will use a dataset that includes data about credit applicants to develop and train a model that will assist in determining if the applicantâ€™s profile is suitable to enter the lending process; otherwise, it will be rejected.

#### The value of predicting the loan defaults:
- To identify the features and behavioral patterns that contribute to future debt repayment problems.
- Because loans are risky but also a valuable commodity for the business, utilizing a machine learning model can assist in identifying high-risk consumers by    predicting the factors impacting payback. As a result, it helps lenders reduce their losses.
- Predicting high-risk consumers enables businesses to strike a balance between risk and profit.
  Additionally, it contributes to profit growth by boosting client access to loans.
