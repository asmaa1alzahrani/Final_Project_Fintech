### Project:
Predicting Loan Defaults using ML model

### What is your project?
The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict and comprehend the previous customers' profiles in order to mitigate future loan default risk. We will use a dataset that includes data about credit applicants to develop and train a model that will assist in determining if the applicant’s profile is suitable to enter the lending process; otherwise, it will be rejected.
